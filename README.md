The book "Automate the Boring Stuff" has a great API exercise in Chapter 16.

The API to the weather site has changed since publication, so this is an updated script to pull the weather. This works with just the city as an input. You may have to do some editing and include a state if you're looking for a commonly named city!

Hope this helps!
